* Idea
Think of a Castlevania inspired running game
* Level
- The player runs through the level until he dies
- Along the level, he collects various items
  - keys, weapons, armor, etc.
  - most items collected are persistent through lives
    - That is after dying most items collected are retained
* Mechanic
- After dying the level is restarted
- Most likely the player will realize that more of the level is accessible
  because of the new items he collected
  - For example
    - The player collected a hammer
    - He can now smash large boulders
- In the hammer/boulder example, the level will permanently open a "fork" that
  the player can always access in the coming lives
- Each time the player comes across a previously unlocked fork, he can choose
  whether he takes the fork or continues on the current path
* Thoughts
- The player may find that he can find certain items on one path that open up
  new opportunities on another path
